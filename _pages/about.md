Hello! I'm an engineering physics student at UBC. Engineering physics is a prestigious program that combines mechanical, electrical, and software engineering with theoretical physics to encourage innovation in technology. I've gained invaluable experience across many disciplines.

I'm also part of UBC orbit satellite design team, where I'm an avionics designer, currently worked on a satellite face PCB and firmware!

I did my previous Co-op at ScopeSys, where I got the opportunity to develop a functional prototype for their cLic technology. In my free time, I love to excercise and play guitar

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

▹
Altium
▹
Python
▹
C++
▹
SolidWorks
▹
PyTorch
▹
OpenCV
