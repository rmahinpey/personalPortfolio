# Project overview
The goal of this project was to develop a satellite testing device for UBC orbit. A helmholtz cage is a cage that generates a magnetic field to test to the satellite's control system, with a 3 rotational degree of freedom apparatus (usually a gimbal) that allows the satellite to move freely. 

I performed test to validate simulation data on the magnetic field generated as well as specced out a power supply. I also worked on determining a control scheme to get a stable magnetic field output.
